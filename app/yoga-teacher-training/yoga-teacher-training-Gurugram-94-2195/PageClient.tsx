              Have you encountered the word yoga therapy and wondered why it is
              called therapy? After all, for many, yoga is just a form of
              exercise. Is that suitable? But at the same time, it is also very
              crucial to understand that one of the most essential components of
              yoga is that it is distressing and, at the same time, eventually
              an essential component for feeling relaxed. But to ensure that
              you, as students, feel the best, your instructor's proper training

              If you are someone who often thinks that yoga is just for the body
              and a type of exercise, you are probably mistaken. One of the most
              promising factors about yoga is that it is known to be for the
              soul and body, and here, you try to feel the power of a firm
              being. There are a lot of yoga poses where you need to have a
              powerful mind, without which you will not be able to get the
              proper posture under any circumstances. To ensure that you have
              the proper guidance as an instructor and that your students

              Gurugram is a city of enthusiasts; hence, people have a lot of
              interest and zeal to learn more. However, one of the most noted
              problems is that there needs to be more exposure for those who
              eventually want to take up yoga as a professional career and teach
              students. Because of this respect, we have designed a globally

              , which is exceptionally well-structured. Along with the basics,
              we will also focus on the different schools of yoga. Yoga is a
              broad field; consequently, different schools follow different
              ideals. As an instructor, getting the right kind of exposure to
              all these different methods is necessary, and that is precisely
              what we have been doing so far.

              We understand that, as students, it can sometimes be challenging
              to afford a YTT certification in Gurugram, which is priced
              exorbitantly. However, at the same time, before you start teaching
              anyone, it is crucial that you get registration and have your own
              license because, just as mentioned, yoga is nothing less than
              therapy. Hence, at AYM, we have carefully crafted the course to be
              affordable for all our students. Yet, they can get a globally
              accredited{" "}

              , which can kickstart their career in the mystic field of yoga.
              Always keep in mind that as a yoga instructor, you are teaching
              people how to excel in the correct poses and inculcating a way of
              life.
