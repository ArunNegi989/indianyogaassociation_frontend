              The Association for Yoga and Meditation's inception was to ensure
              that all the individuals who want to set up a professional career
              for themselves as yoga instructors get the best exposure. Hence
              with the same concept in mind, we have designed the Yoga training

              innate knowledge to impart. An essential thing that you need to
              keep in mind as an instructor is that yoga is not only about being
              able to bend your body in different ways. It is about your mental
              and physical peace. You have to come to a state where you are able

              Both yoga and meditation go hand in hand, which makes us believe
              that understanding the right method for both of them is mandatory.
              Meditation also has the right process which requires quite some
              time to master. We have incorporated a system where the entire
              structure is based on the gurukul environment, and it
              automatically helps our students as well to stay in such a
              dimension and slowly master their bit of knowledge. We duly
              believe that not only the basics but the students who are enrolled
              with us at AYM also need to have a better understanding of the
              advanced sectors as well to develop their craft slowly. To make
              sure that you have been able to focus enough on each of the
              sectors and learn from it, you require passing every sector for a
              better <strong className={styles.boldLink}>consolidation</strong>.

              that we have got accords you with certification once you are done
              with the successful completion. One of the major perks of this
              certification is that it allows you to start with your career and
              you can choose to train students under you as well. You might have
              often seen that we consider Yoga as therapy and hence the
              therapist needs to be professionally trained as well. The course
              that we have framed is a yoga therapy teacher training course that
              trains you in the right way and helps you to start your career as
              an instructor. After all, would you ever choose to learn something
              like yoga from anyone who is not certified or licensed? The same
              question will come up to anyone's mind before joining your course.
              So you'll definitely need a certification that is globally
              accredited.
